														Greetings, I'm Mark Janssen M. Valencia, a resident of Barangka, Marikina City, currently navigating the exciting realm of Computer Engineering as a third-year student at The Technological Institute of the Philippines. At the youthful age of 20, I celebrate my existence every May 28th since 2003. <br><br>

														My journey into the realm of Computer Engineering was a natural evolution, rooted in a passion that germinated during my elementary days. Back then, my family owned a Computer cafe, and my daily interactions with computers stoked the flames of curiosity within me. This early exposure laid the foundation for a lifelong fascination with computers and servers.<br><br>

														Before embarking on this academic path, I meticulously examined the curriculum, and one particular course, Sysad 2 (Managing Enterprise Servers), captivated my imagination. The allure of delving into the intricacies of server management resonated deeply with me. The spark ignited during my time at the family's computer cafe had grown into a full-blown passion.<br><br>

														I found myself irresistibly drawn to servers, and the dream of setting up my own became a driving force. Now, picture this: my personal server rack, proudly housing not just servers, but also my customized NAS device and an array of networking equipment. It's a testament to the journey that began in my elementary years and has flourished into a full-fledged commitment.<br><br>

														As I stride confidently into the future, I am resolute in my decision to specialize in the Systems Administration Track for my undergraduate degree. The melding of my childhood hobby, family business, and academic pursuits has shaped me into an aspiring systems administrator, ready to explore the boundless possibilities of managing enterprise servers.</p>
